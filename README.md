## Rules of the game
* Objective remains the same as classic Tic-Tac-Toe; Get a line of 3 of your symbols before your opponent
* You can override your opponent's symbols by placing your symbol over it if your symbol is larger than the target symbol.
* The game will draw if there aren't any more valid moves for the current player.
